# 100 Days of CUDA Challenge
Welcome to my 100-day CUDA challenge — a daily push to sharpen my parallel programming skills, one kernel at a time. 
From simple computations to advanced GPU algorithms, this is my hands-on journey to mastering CUDA and high-performance computing.

### Day 1
Kickstarting with the basics — squaring 100 numbers in parallel. Clean, efficient, and GPU-accelerated. 

**Key Learnings**
- Learned how to launch a CUDA kernel with proper grid and block dimensions.
- Understood thread indexing to map computations to data.
- Practiced basic parallel output using printf from device code
